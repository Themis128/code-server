# Upgrade

To upgrade code-server, install the new version over the old version. All user
data is in `~/.local/share/code-server`, so they are preserved between
installations.
# run this command inside the code-server directory
ln -s $PREFIX/bin/rg ./vendor/modules/code-oss-dev/vscode-ripgrep/bin/rg
