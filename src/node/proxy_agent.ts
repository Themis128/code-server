/**
 * monkeyPatch patches the node http and https modules to route all requests through the

 *
 * We do not support $HTTPS_PROXY here as it's equivalent in proxy-agent.
 * See the mapping at https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent
 *
 * I guess with most proxies support both HTTP and HTTPS proxying on the same port and
 * so two variables aren't required anymore. And there's plenty of SOCKS proxies too where
 * it wouldn't make sense to have two variables.
 *
 * It's the most performant/secure setup as using a HTTP proxy for HTTP requests allows
 * for caching but then using a HTTPS proxy for HTTPS requests gives full end to end
 * security.
 *
 * See https://stackoverflow.com/a/10442767/4283659 for HTTP vs HTTPS proxy.
 * To be clear, both support HTTP/HTTPS resources, the difference is in how they fetch
 * them.
